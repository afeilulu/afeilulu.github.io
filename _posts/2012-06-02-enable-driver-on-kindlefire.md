There is no driver official,and also no any install package.All you need if to follow <a title="kindlefire usb driver" href="http://www.jayceooi.com/2011/12/13/how-to-install-kindle-fire-adb-usb-driver/">this article</a>.

But you should keep it in mind that it only works on kindle fire default stack.After you flash a rom such as gedeRom or something else based on cm9,things change.

In this case , you should uninstall the driver firstly,unplug your kindle fire and plug in again.Windows will install a new driver for you device, and your usb debug and usb massive storage  will works. You will find that the device name become "Google Nexus" or something else depending on what rom you  flashed.

The above works on windows7 64Bit version.
